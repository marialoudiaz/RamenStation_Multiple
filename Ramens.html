      <p>Tonkotsu Ramen: This classic Japanese dish features a rich and creamy broth made from pork bones that have been simmered for hours to extract their flavor. The noodles are thin and straight, with a firm texture that pairs well with the tender slices of chashu pork, marinated bamboo shoots, and soft-boiled egg.</p>

The broth is typically made from seafood, chicken, or pork, and is often flavored with soy sauce, mirin, or vinegar. The toppings can vary, but may include chashu pork, boiled egg, nori, and bamboo shoots.</p>

The broth has a delicate flavor that allows the toppings to shine, which may include sliced pork, menma (fermented bamboo shoots), green onions, and nori.
